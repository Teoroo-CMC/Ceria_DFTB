The data used in the fitting of the repulsive potential in the paper `Towards an efficient f-in-core/f-in-valence switchable
description for DFTB calculations of Ce 4f states in ceria` are located in folders: ``IN_CORE/TRAINING_DATA`` and ``IN_VAL/TRAINING_DATA``.
The data is stored in the Atomic Simulation Environment (`ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`_) data-base format.
