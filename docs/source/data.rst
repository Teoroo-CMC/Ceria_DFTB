The data used in the fitting of the repulsive potential in the paper `Towards an efficient f-in-core/f-in-valence switchable
description for DFTB calculations of Ce 4f states in ceria` are located in the folders ``INCORE/TRAINING_DATA`` and ``INVAL/TRAINING_DATA`` which contains data for the f-in-core
and f-in-valence approches, respectively.
The data is stored in the Atomic Simulation Environment (`ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`_) data-base format.
